(1) Three presets (MOPline-8t, MOPline-7t-1, MOPline-7t-2) and the run_INSurVeylor.pl script have been added to allow the use of INS calls from INSurVeylor (Rajaby et al., Nat. Commun. 14, 3243 2023; https://github.com/kensung-lab/INSurVeyor). See README for details. However, we assume that you will run the tool using the singularity sif file provided on INSurVeylor's github site, so our singularity def file (mopline.def) does not include INSurVeylor's installation description.
